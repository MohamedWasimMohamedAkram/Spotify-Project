# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Spotify-Project
Spotify UI designed to fetch data and retrieve search results from a JSON file

#Functionality
The homepage functions well with all the albums having their specified properties (such as cover image, name and album) while also having the overlay with the animation for each of the albums. However, there are some bugs in the UI.
Firstly, the search bar needs to be clicked to go to the search page and it has to be clicked again to enter the search bar. To enter the search bar, you need to click the search bar a little above or below the search bar. The layout in the search page is also a little flawed due to some positioning mistakes. 
The search and retrieve works perfectly and all the songs in the JSON file can be retrieved by typing the name in the search bar.
P.S
One of the cover art URL is unavailable so it doesn't show in the search page. In the main page, that same image was used but I changed it to another URL so the cover art is visible.
